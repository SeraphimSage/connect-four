// Connect Four Assessment Outline

/* 1.	Display game area and create a grid/ dataset for the game area. 
    a.	Create a 7 column-by-6 row game area with a div consisting of various smaller row, column, 
    diagonal, and cell divs (kind of like in the maze assessment).
    b.	Display grid to show separation of game area by using border styling in CSS.
    c.	Create a dataset to assign values to each cell so they’ll be easier to send each chip to.
2.	Chips alternate colors for players and drop into chosen columns.
    a.	Create either a click handler or a keyboard event listener to assign columns input so players 
    can choose where chips will appear (kind of like in the tower of hanoi).
    b.	Create check to see which player is going next and assign a chip class with the red color to one 
    player and the black color to the other to form opposing players.
    c.	Add animation for chips.
    d.	Add a conditional statement to detect collisions into cells with chips already in them to make 
    sure that chips fall on top of each other, not underneath each other.
3.	Game checks vertical, horizontal, and diagonal to see if game is won.
    a.	Create loop to search for win condition. 
    b.	Display alert when conditions are met.
    c.	Restart the game (and maybe keep score?) */
